Notes on Implementation:
    - the initial screen is a empty list of all rides
    - use add button to add Ride
    - long click on ride item to Edit
    - click on ride item to See detail and see the option to delete
    - click on the delete button for each Ride, to delete
    - a AlertDialog will ask if you are sure before deleting
    - When Editing/Adding Ride, the Ride attribute input values are validated,
      errors will be showing at the TextView, saving will not be performed
      until all inputs are valid.
